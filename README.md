# TwoSecondRAWebScrape

This is just a quick Scrapy implementation to grab all prompt/answer/difficulty tuples from www.remote-associates-test.com

It uses vanilla Scrapy features to scrape and output data in JSON format. As of the creation of this repo, the remote associates
WebGL application does not support reading in JSON but by the time anyone other than me cares about this repo, it will.
